First, a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model will be trained on the EMNIST letter dataset and the trained model will be evaluated on the test dataset to identify a baseline accuracy for the STN. Then STN is added to the same CNN model and re-trained with the same EMNIST dataset. The accuracy is calculated on the test dataset. This accuracy is expected to be higher due to the use of STN in the model. We plan to start with a small neural network with few layers.
